Inferring the occurrence rate of exoplanets from noisy observations
===================================================================

We have developed a probabilistic framework for making justified
self-consistent inferences about the occurrence rate of exoplanets given an
incomplete catalog with noisy measurements. This method is built on a fully
generative model or likelihood function for the catalog and it takes
observational uncertainties and selection effects into account. In the limit
of vanishing uncertainties, our method delivers a lower variance estimate of
the occurrence rate than the standard inverse-detection-efficiency weighting
scheme. When we take observational uncertainties into account, we have
demonstrated that all the standard methods produce biased and overly
optimistic constraints on the occurrence rate. In this talk, I'll motivate the
need for a method like this by applying the standard techniques to simulated
data and present the result of applying this model to the exoplanet candidate
catalog produced by Petigura et al. (2013).
