\begin{abstract}
Although no true extra-solar Earth analog is known, hundreds of planets have
been found around Sun-like stars that are either Earth-sized but on shorter
periods, or else on year-long orbits but somewhat bigger than Earth.
These populations ought to permit a (possibly highly uncertain) extrapolated
measurement of the probability or rate at which Sun-like stars host true Earth
analogs.
Here we build a set of probabilistic models of the population of known small
planets around G dwarfs.
The models all take into account the transit probability and the completeness
(or detection efficiency) as a function of planet radius and orbital period.
Because we forward model the data, we do not ever have to perform the
traditional weighting of the data by the inverse detection efficiency.
Our most sophisticated models do not assume that the joint radius--period
distribution is separable, and correctly take into account the significant
observational uncertainties on the planet radii, using the machinery of
hierarchical inference.
We reconsider and confirm with weaker assumptions prior results on the
distribution of exoplanet radii that show a flattening of the distribution
below a few Earth radii.
One output of our models is fully marginalized estimates---marginalizing out
observational uncertainties and all distribution parameters---of the rate
density of true Earth analogs, expressed as a number of planets per star per
natural logarithmic interval of radius and period, evaluated at the properties
of Earth.
The rate density we infer is an extrapolation; it depends strongly on the
permitted flexibility of the distribution model, but it tends to come out
at around ten percent, with large uncertainty.

\section{Introduction}

STUFF HERE ABOUT EARTH ANALOGS.

This study is novel in a number of ways.
We create probabilistic information about the full exoplanet population
  \emph{not} by weighting the detected objects by the inverse detection efficiency (CITE PETIGURA),
  but rather by forward modeling the observed distribution subject to the detection efficienty.
Re-weighting the data by inverse selection probability---%
  a method called V-max in the quasar and galaxy luminosity function contexts---%
  is not wrong,
  but it produces a higher-variance estimate of the population than a justified likelihood approach.
One simple intuition along these lines is that the inverse probability weights can be large in dynamic range,
  so the effective number of samples, after weighting, can be much smaller than the actual number of samples.
Another is that it tends to upweight most strongly the most marginal detections in the data sample,
  since these tend to be the samples that lie in the region of lowest completeness.
In this work, we build a justified likelihood of the observed data,
  taking into account the completeness function or detection efficiency.
Our likelihood function is a variable-rate Poisson likelihood;
  it makes the fundamental assumption that the data points are independently drawn from the model,
  but is agnostic about all other properties of the data or distribution functions.
Indeed, the assumptions behind this study are weaker than those of any previous study
  of the Earth-analog population (CITE PETIGURA, DONG).

Another new aspect of this study is that it makes use of very flexible distribution function models.
Indeed most of the models we consider are ``non-parametric'' in the weak sense
  that they have enormous numbers of free parameters
  (not the strong sense of having an \emph{infinite} number of free parameters).
The models are protected from degeneracies and over-fitting by priors.
In some models we assume that the two-dimensional distribution of planets
  in radius and period is separable;
  in others we don't.
We treat all of these parameters as ``nuisance parameters'' when we ask questions
  about the occurrence of Earth analogs.
That is, our rate conclusions are fully marginalized,
  and those marginalizations are over non-trivial numbers of parameters.

When, in what follows, we ask questions about the radius disribution of exoplanets,
  the distribution parameters are no longer nuisances
The radius-distribution parameters are what we are trying to measure.
Even in this case, however, our results will have the period-distribution parameters marginalized out.

Perhaps the most important novelty of this study is in its treatment of observational uncertainties.
Although planet periods in our data set are very precisely measured,
  the planet radius measurements have large uncertainties.
The justified probabilistic approach to including these uncertainties in a distribution analysis
  is to introduce the ``true'' radii as latent variables and infer and marginalize them out
  along with all other nuisance parameters.
Although this sounds expensive---and it can be---%
  there is a simple approach we have been advocating (CITE HOGG) that makes use of importance sampling.
We use this approach here;
  our results are fully marginalized over posterior uncertainties in all of the planet radii.
More will be said about this below;
  the importance sampling looks like a product over data points
  of sums (averages) over individual-datum radius samplings.

\section{The model}

\emph{Note: I think that we should use $T$ instead of $P$ for period because
$P$ is too heavily overloaded by the probabilities\ldots}

We have some parametric function \rate\ describing the true rate of exoplanets
with periods \period\ and radii \radius
\begin{eqnarray}\eqlabel{true-rate}
\rate (\period,\,\radius;\,\ratepars)
&=& \frac{\dd N}{\dd\ln\period\dd\ln\radius}\quad.
\end{eqnarray}
Here we have not made any assumptions about the functional form of \rate, we
are only stating that it can be modeled by some---possibly very large---set of
parameters \ratepars.

In this \paper, we will assume that the completeness function of the survey is
known and it can be represented as a probability at every period and radius
$\completeness (\period,\,\radius)$.
Similarly, we can consider the marginalized transit probability $\transitprob
(\period)$ as only a function of period.
These selection effects can be incorporated into the rate from \eq{true-rate}
to get the \emph{observed rate}
\begin{eqnarray}\eqlabel{obs-rate}
\obs{\rate} (\period,\,\radius;\,\ratepars)
&=& \rate (\period,\,\radius;\,\ratepars)\,\completeness(\period,\,\radius)\,
\transitprob(\period)\quad.
\end{eqnarray}

Now we will make the further assumption that every candidate in our sample of
detected exoplanets is an independent Poisson sample from the population
described by our rate function.
Under this assumption, the likelihood of the catalog conditioned on a set of
parameters \ratepars\ is (see Appendix XXXXX for a derivation)
\begin{eqnarray}
\ln p(\period,\,\radius\,|\,\ratepars) &\propto&
\sum_{k=1}^K \ln\obs{\rate} (\period_k,\,\radius_k;\,\ratepars)
- \int \obs{\rate} (\period,\,\radius;\,\ratepars) \dd\period\dd\radius
\quad.
\end{eqnarray}

\section{Including observational uncertainties}

In the previous section, we implicitly assumed that the measurements of
\period\ and \radius\ given by the catalog were perfect, without any
observational uncertainties.
This isn't a terrible approximation for the period measurements but not for
the radii.
Luckily, it is not hard to include these effects in our probabilistic
framework.

In general, catalogs produce posterior probability distributions for
quantities conditioned on data.
In particular, the catalog that we're considering here provides estimates of
the posterior distribution of \period\ and \radius\ conditioned on the
observables $\obs{\period}$ and $\obs{\radius}$ under some \emph{interim
priors} parameterized by \interim
\begin{eqnarray}
p(\period,\,\radius\,|\,\obs{\period},\,\obs{\radius},\,\interim) \quad.
\end{eqnarray}
This estimate can be propagated as \emph{posterior samples}
\begin{eqnarray}
\{\period^{(n)},\,\radius^{(n)}\} &\sim&
p(\period,\,\radius\,|\,\obs{\period},\,\obs{\radius},\,\interim) \quad.
\end{eqnarray}

Now the quantity that we need to compute is again the (marginalized)
likelihood of the data $\obs{\period}$ and $\obs{\radius}$ conditioned on a
set of rate function parameters \ratepars
\begin{eqnarray}
p(\obs{\period},\,\obs{\radius}\,|\,\ratepars) &=&
\int p(\period,\,\radius,\,\obs{\period},\,\obs{\radius}\,|\,\ratepars)
\dd\period\dd\radius \\
&=&
\int p(\period,\,\radius\,|\,\ratepars) \,
p(\obs{\period},\,\obs{\radius}\,|\,\period,\,\radius)
\dd\period\dd\radius \\
&=&
\int p(\period,\,\radius\,|\,\ratepars) \,
p(\obs{\period},\,\obs{\radius}\,|\,\period,\,\radius)\,
\frac{p(\period,\,\radius\,|\,\obs{\period},\,\obs{\radius},\,\interim)}
     {p(\period,\,\radius\,|\,\obs{\period},\,\obs{\radius},\,\interim)}
\dd\period\dd\radius \\
&=&
p(\obs{\period},\,\obs{\radius}\,|\,\interim)\,
\int
\frac{p(\period,\,\radius\,|\,\ratepars) \,
      p(\obs{\period},\,\obs{\radius}\,|\,\period,\,\radius)}
     {p(\period,\,\radius\,|\,\interim) \,
      p(\obs{\period},\,\obs{\radius}\,|\,\period,\,\radius)}\,
p(\period,\,\radius\,|\,\obs{\period},\,\obs{\radius},\,\interim)
\dd\period\dd\radius \\
\frac{p(\obs{\period},\,\obs{\radius}\,|\,\ratepars)}
     {p(\obs{\period},\,\obs{\radius}\,|\,\interim)}
&=&
\int
\frac{p(\period,\,\radius\,|\,\ratepars)}
     {p(\period,\,\radius\,|\,\interim)} \,
p(\period,\,\radius\,|\,\obs{\period},\,\obs{\radius},\,\interim)
\dd\period\dd\radius \\
&\approx&
\frac{1}{N}
\sum_{n=1}^N
\frac{p(\period^{(n)},\,\radius^{(n)}\,|\,\ratepars)}
     {p(\period^{(n)},\,\radius^{(n)}\,|\,\interim)}
\end{eqnarray}

\section{Results}

\section{Discussion}

We have made the first measurement of the Earth-like exoplanet population
  that is based on forward modeling,
  takes proper account of the observational uncertainties on planet radii,
  and makes use of extremely flexible non-separable distributions for radius and period.
We find BLAH BLAH BLAH.

Although our method makes weaker assumptions than any previous work in this area,
  of course it \emph{does} make strong assumptions.
It assumes that the data set (provided by CITE PETIGURA)
  contains planets and only planets (no false positives).
It assumes that the individual-planet radius uncertainties
  are also correctly determined.
It assumes that the completeness calculation (CITE PETIGURA)
  is accurate and smoothly varying with radius and period;
  it makes no attempt to adjust the completeness star-by-star for brightness or variability.
It assumes that the exoplanets are all independently drawn from the same distribution function,
  with no regard to age, metallicity, or multiplicity.

Although we have taken account of the radius uncertainties in a principled way,
  we did make one important approximation:
We ignored planets with central values far outside the radius and period box in which we built the model.
That is, we assumed that there are no very large outliers in radius determination.
This assumption is a complex one;
  it involves the effective, end-to-end error distribution in the data set,
  but also smoothness of the distribution function at or near the edges of the analysis box.

If our inferences are right about true Earth analogs,
  then we expect that there are about XXX transiting Earth analogs
  hidden in the \kepler\ data set.
We would be able to find some of these Earth analogs if the effective noise level in the data could be reduced
  by a factor of about XXX.
We have identified a number of directions along which this noise reduction might happen,
  including but not limited to
  retrospective data-driven or physics-driven recalibrations of the \kepler\ focal plane (CITE HOGG WHITEPAPER),
  new methods for performing aperture photometry (NOTHING TO CITE),
  and better models for stochastic stellar variability that take account of frequency structure (CITE CARTER, BREWER, AIGRAIN).
If any (or all) of these deliver substantial improvements for \kepler\ archival data reanalyses,
  it's Nobel Prize time!  (Or at least \textsl{The Colbert Report}?)
